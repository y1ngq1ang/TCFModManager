// schema admitting six means adding Czech or Arabic later is a resx change plus one rule here, with

// .NET exposes no CLDR plural data - CultureInfo has nothing for it - so the rules are ours to
// write. Per R3 a rule is written for every language actually shipped, and a test fails if one is
// offered in the dropdown without a rule here.
//
// Each shipped language gets its own arm even when it lands on a shape another already uses. German
// and Italian could sit on English's, and the compiler would not care - but an arm is the record
// that a language was looked at, and a list that merges them cannot be read for which ones have
// been.
//
// Lives in Core rather than beside the resx for one reason: it is the part of this design that can
// be silently wrong in a way that is expensive to fix later, and Core is what the test project can
// reach. It holds no prose, so D10 is untouched.
